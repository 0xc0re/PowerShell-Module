Community PowerShell Module for Rubrik
============================

This is a community project that provides a Windows PowerShell module for managing and monitoring Rubrik's Converged Data Management platform.

# Requirements

The code assumes that you've already deployed at least one Brik into your environment and have completed the initial configuration process. At a minimum, make sure you have installed the following:

1. PowerShell version 4 or newer
2. PowerCLI version 5.8 or newer

# Installation

This repository contains a folder named `Rubrik`. The folder needs to be installed into one of your PowerShell Module Paths.

##### Option 1: Automated Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/rubrikinc/PowerShell-Module/releases/latest) or any pre-release build to your workstation.
2. Open a Powershell console with the *Run as Administrator* option.
3. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy` using the parameter `RemoteSigned` or `Bypass`.
2. Run the `Install-Rubrik.ps1` script in the root of this repository and follow the prompt to install the module into your `$Home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\` path.
3. At the completion of the installation, the installer will run `Import-Module Rubrik` on your behalf.

##### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/rubrikinc/PowerShell-Module/releases/latest) or any pre-release build to your workstation.
2. Copy the contents of the `Rubrik` folder onto your workstation into the PowerShell Module Path `$Home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\` or `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`
2. Open a Powershell console with the *Run as Administrator* option.
3. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy` using the parameter `RemoteSigned` or `Bypass`.
5. To load the module, use `Import-Module Rubrik`.

# Usage Instructions

To see help for any single cmdlet, use `Get-Help <cmdlet>` combined with any of the optional parameters: `-Detailed` or `-Examples` or `-Full`

# Future

The community module is not officially supported and should be **used at your own risk**.

A future release will offer API versioning and may also include formal support.
